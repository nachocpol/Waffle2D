Emscripten compiles C++/C code into JS/WASM. Stuff like OpenGL is also supported.

To install it follow the instructions in: https://emscripten.org/docs/getting_started/downloads.html#sdk-download-and-install

To run  the commands use emsdk.py

Then you can open the console as they ask and test the programs. By default, the ouput goes to the emscripten folder.
